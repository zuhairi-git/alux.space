## 🔧 Recent Fixes Applied

### Navigation Bar Margin Fix
- **Issue**: Audio library pages were rendering content behind the fixed navigation bar
- **Solution**: Added `pt-16` (64px) top padding to both AudioLibrary and AudioPage components
- **Impact**: Content now properly displays with appropriate spacing below the navigation bar

### Sticky Header Positioning
- **Issue**: Sticky header in AudioLibrary was positioned at `top-0` ignoring navigation
- **Solution**: Changed sticky positioning to `top-16` to account for navigation bar height
- **Result**: Filter header now sticks properly below the navigation when scrolling

### Navigation Integration
- **Maintained**: Navigation components remain in client wrappers as intended
- **Structure**: Each audio page includes Navigation + main content in proper layout
- **Client Components**: AudioLibraryClient and AudioPageClient handle client-side functionality

## 🚀 Future Enhancement Ready

The system is designed for easy expansion:

### Adding New Audio Files:
1. Add audio file to `/public/audio/` directory
2. Add metadata entry to `audioLibrary.ts`
3. Pages automatically generate via static generation

### New Categories/Tags:
- Simply add to metadata - system automatically updates filters
- No code changes required for new categories

### Multilingual Support:
- Language field in metadata
- Easy to extend for additional languages
- Navigation already supports EN/FI
