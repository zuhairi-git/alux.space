# Portfolio Website

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

1. First, set up your environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Then edit `.env` and add your Unsplash API credentials from https://unsplash.com/developers

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   # or
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   # or
   pnpm dev
   # or
   bun dev
   ```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

The following environment variables are required:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY`: Your Unsplash API access key
