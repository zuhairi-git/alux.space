# Alux Design System

A comprehensive, accessible, and theme-aware design system built from real-world usage patterns.

## Overview

This design system was created by analyzing and systematizing the existing components and patterns used throughout the Alux website. It provides a scalable, consistent foundation for building user interfaces that work across three distinct themes and support international audiences.

## Key Features

## Development Integration

### Installation
The design system is integrated directly into the existing codebase and accessible through:

```typescript
import { designTokens } from '@/ds/tokens';
import { Button, Card, Navigation } from '@/ds/components';
```

### Token Usage
```typescript
// Use design tokens for consistent styling
const cardStyle = {
  background: designTokens.colors.semantic.background.light,
  padding: designTokens.spacing.semantic.component.md,
  borderRadius: designTokens.spacing.borderRadius.card,
  boxShadow: designTokens.shadows.boxShadow['card-light']
};
```

### Component Examples
```typescript
// Button usage with all variants
<Button variant="primary" size="lg">Primary Action</Button>
<Button variant="secondary" size="md">Secondary Action</Button>
<Button variant="ghost" size="sm">Minimal Action</Button>
<Button variant="cosmic" size="xl">Special Action</Button>

// Card usage with theme adaptation
<Card variant="primary" hoverEffect={true}>
  <CardContent>Your content here</CardContent>
</Card>
```
