How to get notifications on iOS with personal focus on?

Are you one of those people who have been experiencing difficulty getting notifications on your iPhone lately? Well, you're not alone! Recently, I went through a similar experience where I was not getting notifications from the Mail app on my iPhone, despite trying various email clients.

After conducting some research and finding no solutions, I began playing with my phone settings to determine what the issue might be. And, after a few minutes of tinkering, I noticed the Personal icon on my lock screen, which I had activated out of curiosity some time ago and it was the cause of the problem. I realized that I needed to add people and apps to my personal focus profile to receive or see notifications.

While it is crucial to approach this idea with caution, contemplating the potential outcomes is both intriguing and thought-provoking.

Beyond the Boundaries of Human Limitations:
One of the primary drivers behind this belief is the limitations inherent in the human condition. Despite our remarkable achievements, humans are constrained by biological factors, including our cognitive capacities, lifespan, and susceptibility to errors. In contrast, AI systems have the potential to transcend these limitations, offering the ability to process and analyze vast amounts of information rapidly, make unbiased decisions, and continuously improve without succumbing to fatigue or emotional biases.

A Synergistic Future:
Rather than envisioning a dystopian future where humans are rendered obsolete, it is essential to emphasize the potential for a harmonious coexistence between humans and AI. As AI advances, it can become an invaluable tool to augment human intelligence and creativity. By leveraging the unique strengths of both humans and machines, we can solve complex problems, explore new frontiers of knowledge, and unlock unimagined possibilities.

Society must navigate questions surrounding privacy, fairness, accountability, and the distribution of benefits arising from AI advancements. Additionally, investments in education and reskilling initiatives will be crucial to equip individuals with the skills necessary to thrive in an AI-driven world.

Conclusion:
The belief that AI and ML advancements will lead our world to unparalleled sophistication, potentially rendering humans primitive in comparison, is a thought-provoking concept. As AI continues to evolve, it holds immense potential to transform society, industries, and our very notion of what it means to be human. It is crucial to approach this journey with a balanced perspective, embracing the opportunities that arise while ensuring that human values and ethics guide our path forward. By doing so, we can shape a future where humans and AI coexist symbiotically, harnessing the vast potential of both to create a world that transcends our current limitations.

After Conclusion
In case you are still uncertain or sceptical, it is important to note that the article thus far has been created by an AI, utilizing my statement: "I have a feeling that with the progress of AI and the advancements in machine learning, our world will reach such a level of sophistication that most humans may appear primitive once more." I must admit, it is quite remarkable.

Chapter Tow - Focus on Human
Pivotal Moment
The inception of this idea behind this article was not driven by me being against AI, but rather by a profound belief in the significance of expanding our understanding of the ever-changing world and redefining educational principles. We stand at a pivotal moment in history, where the path we tread holds the potential for irreversible consequences. This demands a profound change in our approach to education and the work environment. As I often emphasize, the focus should not solely be on enhancing the intelligence of our surroundings. Instead, we ought to explore ways to enhance human capabilities and embrace the enhancement of our creativity.

Human
To accomplish this, in my opinion, there are three key points to consider:

Know-what: It is crucial to understand what AI is and how developers interact with it at a code level. This ensure gaining knowledge about the inner workings of AI systems.
Know-why: We must strive to reach a collective understanding and, ideally, an agreement on why we need AI. This involves recognizing the benefits and potential risks associated with its implementation.
Know-how: By mastering the first two points, we can begin to establish regulations or boundaries that are universally understood and accepted.
It is important to understand the ever-changing world and redefining educational principles to cope with new sophisticated challenges we are currently facing.

Chapter Three - Rewrite the rules
Robotics Ruls for Human
The core element revolves around control, and those who possess it can govern and shape the course of events. While humans in positions of control may occasionally make mistakes, the situation may differ when it comes to AI and its sophisticated problem-solving abilities. The one with the most reliable decision-making pattern can eventually determine the outcome of matters that hold utmost importance to humans, such as the value of things and the establishment of rules.

Now, let's envision a world without traditional rules, and for that, I would like to propose three rules of robotics and convert them into three rules for humans:
First attempt:

Individuals must comply with and respect the autonomy and well-being of others.
Individuals must avoid actions or situations that may physically or psychologically harm other humans.
Within their domain, individuals are free to act as they wish as long as their actions align with the principles outlined in the first and second laws.
My first attempt to build on the idea of exploiting the concept of control and decision making in a world where AI plays a significant role sounds good enough for me. Now, bear in mind that you should shift your mindset to understand this vision. It may not appear practical, but think about a world without any authoritarian force, where humans simply live side by side in a world that caters to all human needs.

Chapter Four - UtopiAI
What if..?
When we are deeply committed to creating a society that can fulfill the requirements of decent living for everyone, people will shift their mindset from working to live or working to get rich to instead enjoying living. The focus of creativity will also shift towards exploring how to prolong life and determining the best practices for enhancing human well-being. In this transformed society, relationships will also undergo change, consequently significantly altering the need for having multiple children. By taking this vision further and imagine a utopian society where the focus shifts from working form material gain to enjoying life and exploring ways to enhance human well-being.

Chapter Five - The Impact
Eruption of changes
AI's influence on our lives is of supreme importance in the present day. It has caused an eruption of changes and rendered many job positions redundant by automating tasks, all thanks to its ability to fulfill numerous requests, provide solutions, and generate ideas with very little human interaction.

AI's rapid advancement as a powerful tool to produce results effortlessly makes it a great replacement for many positions and assistance jobs previously managed by humans. As humans, we are impatient and want answers instantly, so what could be better than having something that won't get tired or complain when asked too many questions?

It is inevitable that AI will replace, disrupt, and change many things. However, there might be hidden treasure for those who can cope with this change and adapt to the new era where AI is involved in everything.

Final Conclusion
In conclusion, for engaging in this game, it is imperative to establish clear and simplified rules that can be easily understood by all participants. Instead of complex and often ignored rules akin to a book of law, we should adopt straightforward guidelines. Achieving a common understanding of what AI is, its significance, and the purpose of implementing ground rules for its use is essential. These rules should be designed to enhance our lives, considering the impact of AI on both technical and non-technical individuals. By doing so, we can foster a conducive environment for AI's responsible and beneficial integration into our society.

What is coming next?
Having discussed the significance of AI, it is worth noting that there is already an ideation of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). AGI refers to a machine that can learn and comprehend any intellectual task that a human being can, and can even develop capabilities beyond the scope of traditional AI systems.

AGI
